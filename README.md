## ğŸ‘‹ Hi there,
*I'm sanana, sanana the skenana.*

I like playing games and spending time working on useless projects that I don't end up publishing so I have basically nothing here. Most of my projects are my old stuff that I wrote when I did not even know English. ğŸ˜„

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on private projects.
