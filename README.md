*I'm sanana, sanana the skenana.*

I like playing games and spending time working on useless projects that I don't end up publishing so I have basically nothing here. Most of my projects are my old stuff that I wrote when I did not even know English. ğŸ˜„

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [`untitled-minecraft-launcher`](https://github.com/TheOddGarlic/untitled-minecraft-launcher) and private projects.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him or they/them.
