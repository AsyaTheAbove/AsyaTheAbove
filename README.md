## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,
[<img src="https://theoddgarlic.js.org/img/github-readme/im-sanana.jpg" width="360" height="296"/>](https://github.com/theoddgarlic)

*I'm sanana, sanana the skenana.*

I like playing games and spending time working on useless projects that I don't end up publishing so I have basically nothing here. Most of my projects are my old stuff that I wrote when I did not even know English. ðŸ˜„

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on private projects.
